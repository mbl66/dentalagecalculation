# dentalagecalculation
Download the MFH file and upload alongside your data. Sample data structure is attached. This code seperates by geographic region of skeletal collection, delete if looking to calculate all dental ages without subsetting data. 
Once the specimen is assigned all means and standrad deviations, a sheet will export with this information, which then will run through the second part of the code calculating the dental age.
The final output will be a CSV file with the specimen number and dental age.
